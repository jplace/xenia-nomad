Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Must go faster. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!

I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Life finds a way. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. What do they got in there? King Kong?

Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
